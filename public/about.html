<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ertuğrul Ghazi, also known as Ertuğrul (died c. 1280/1281), was a 13th-century uch bey (marcher-lord) and the father of Osman I, who founded the Ottoman Empire. 
Much information about Ertuğrul comes from Ottoman traditions that developed long after his era. This makes the historical accuracy of these accounts uncertain. 
According to tradition, Ertuğrul was the son of Suleyman Shah, the leader of the Kayı tribe of Oghuz Turks. 
The tribe migrated to Anatolia from Central Asia to avoid Mongol invasions</p>

<p>Ertuğrul and his followers reportedly entered the service of the Seljuks of Rum after his father's death. 
  They were granted control of Söğüt, a town near the border with the Byzantine Empire. 
  This event is considered, in legend, to have led to the founding of the Ottoman Empire by his son, Osman I. 
  Ertuğrul is often called a Ghazi. 
  This title indicates a heroic fighter for Islam, and it was also used by his son and later descendants. 
  His lineage is traced back to Noah and Oghuz Khagan in sources written about 100-150 years after the Ottoman state was established</p>

<p>Ultimately, Ertuğrul Ghazi was a tribal leader. 
  His actions and legacy are considered foundational to the Ottoman Empire, although details about his life are based on traditions with some historical uncertainty.
